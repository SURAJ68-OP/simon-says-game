# simon-says-game
 
 A classic Simon Says memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tests the player’s memory by generating an increasing sequence of colors that the user must repeat in the correct order.

The application uses JavaScript logic to:


Generate random color sequences

Store and compare user inputs with the game pattern

Increase difficulty level dynamically

Detect wrong moves and reset the game


The UI is designed using CSS for smooth animations and visual feedback, while HTML structures the game layout.
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, arrays, game state management, and basic frontend logic.
